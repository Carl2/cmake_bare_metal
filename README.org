* Overview

  This Repo is project using cmake to develop stm32fxx projects under
  the same repo.  And thereby sharing commmon functionality. It is
  based on the /STM32Cube/ which is downloaded during configure state when running *cmake*.

  The idea was to use the output from [[https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html][StmCubeIde]] to easy incoperate
  the project into cmake.  This means that the easy configuration i.e
  system clocks and peripherals can be made inside /StmCubeIde/ and
  then copy the /Core/ functionality into this project.



** Quick start build

   Lets start to get going.
   There are several ways of building but lets go for the terminal first.

*** Terminal
    Some configuration needs to be done in order for the system to
    figure out what to use.
     - FLAVOR :: These are the projects. For this build we will use the
       /BLACK_PILL/, there are 3 others that can be used /STEPPER,PH_DISCO,sml_test/
       They all depend on setting the other variables right (MCU_CONFIG,CONF_DIR).
     - MCU_CONFIG :: This points to a file which sets some different
       variables/flags during compile time which are related to the
       specific MCU. They are located in:

     #+HEADER: :eval never-export  :results output :wrap example :exports both
     #+begin_src bash :dir (org-entry-get nil "PH-DIR" t)
       ls cmake/mcu_conf/*
     #+end_src

     #+begin_example
     cmake/mcu_conf/stm32f103xb.cmake
     cmake/mcu_conf/stm32f401xc.cmake
     cmake/mcu_conf/stm32f411xe.cmake
     #+end_example

     The project listed are not MCU compatible, which means if you decide to build
     i.e /BLACK_PILL/ you need to use the /stm32f411xe.cmake/ as /MCU_CONFIG/

     So lets try a build example, the configure step may take some time
     (depending on you internet connection) since it will download the /Stm32Cube/ library.

     #+HEADER: :eval never-export  :results output :wrap example :exports both
     #+begin_src bash :dir (org-entry-get nil "PH-DIR" t)
       mkdir black_pill_build cd black_pill_build

       cmake -DFLAVOR=BLACK_PILL \
             -DMCU_CONFIG=stm32f411xe.cmake \
             -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
             ..

     When the build is finished you should be able to find a working solution in

     #+HEADER: :eval never-export  :results output :wrap example :exports both
     #+begin_src bash :dir (org-entry-get nil "PH-DIR" t)
       ls black_pill_build/src/black_pill/BlackPill*
     #+end_src


     #+begin_example
     black_pill_build/src/black_pill/BlackPill
     black_pill_build/src/black_pill/BlackPill.hex
     #+end_example

     The same idea is used with the different project (/stepper,ph_disco,sml_test/).

     The /sml_test/ is somewhat different since it depends on [[https://github.com/boost-ext/sml][sml c++]] header file.
     This can be cloned or downloaded to ~${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/external/~

*** TODO Build type
    When using cmake its possible to use different build types.

    - RelWithDebInfo :: Release with debug info (-O2 -g -DNDEBUG, to be fixed)
    - Debug :: using debug flags
    - Release :: Using optimization (-O2 for now)
    - MinSizeRel :: Optimize for size (-Os) (Not yet fixed!)


    So that leaves us with a command line looking like (building Release):

    #+begin_src bash
             cmake -DFLAVOR=BLACK_PILL \
                   -DMCU_CONFIG=stm32f411xe.cmake \
                   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
                   ..
    #+end_src

    Here are some tests with different sizes.

    | /Project/  | RelWithdebinfo | Debug | Release | MinSizeRel |
    |------------+----------------+-------+---------+------------|
    | Ph_disco   |           9240 | 13696 |    9240 |       8328 |
    | Black_pill |           5668 |  8096 |    5668 |       5332 |




*** Using ccmake
    /ccmake/ is a tui (terminal user interface) that can be a bit
    easier to work with, since you can see the actual
    configurations. Though bare in mind that setting .i.e the
    MCU_CONFIG and configure, leaves the /FLAVOR/ which means you need
    to first update the /MCU_CONFIG/ then configure , then update the /FLAVOR/ the configure again.
    and finally generate, and build. This is hard to explain without some pictures.
    So here is a configuration/build of the /STEPPER/ (stm32f401).

    [[file:doc/ccmake_stepper_conf.gif]]
    [[file:doc/ccmake_stepper_build.gif]]







** Target selection
   In this repository there are 3 working stm32 targets.

    - Black_Pill
    - Stepper
    - PH_disco
    - sml_test

   each of the target resides under src

   #+HEADER: :eval never-export  :results output :wrap example :exports both
   #+begin_src bash :dir (org-entry-get nil "PH-DIR" t)
   tree src -d -L 1
   #+end_src

   #+begin_example
   src
   ├── black_pill
   ├── include
   ├── ph_disco
   ├── sml_test
   └── Stepper

   5 directories
   #+end_example




** Config selection
   The config is based on different board platforms, for example using different configuration for a certain target.
   By selecting /CONF_ONE/ the ~conf_one/config.hpp~ will be selected and selecting /CONF_TWO/ ~conf_two/config.hpp~
   will be selected.
   the tree structure used is:

   #+HEADER: :eval never-export  :results output :wrap example :exports both
   #+begin_src bash :dir "/home/calle/tmp/c++/PH/"
     tree src/include
   #+end_src


   #+begin_example
   src/include
   ├── common
   │   └── common.hpp
   ├── conf_one
   │   └── config.hpp
   └── conf_two
       └── config.hpp

   3 directories, 3 files
   #+end_example

   there is also a common, which are used by all the targets and has common functionality.

** Flashing

using *ccmake* one can set what kind of adapter to use (e.g cmsis-dap)
and the location of the openocd. This can be used to create a
flash target for the project.

#+begin_src cmake
  make_openocd_target(NAME ${TARGET_BIN}
    OPENOCD_PATH ${OPENOCD_PATH}
    OPENOCD_INTERFACE ${OPENOCD_INTERFACE}
    OPENOCD_TARGET stm32f4x
  )
#+end_src

Here is an example when using /stm32f4/ device. See [[file:src/black_pill/CMakeLists.txt::make_openocd_target(NAME ${TARGET_BIN}][black_pill target]]


* Add a new Project (from StmCubeIde)
  The idea here is to use the good features of /StmCubeIde/ for
  configuration i.e clock setup and peripherals configuration.  So
  when all is done and you made sure that the project is working.  Its
  time to add it to the project. Lets now consider that the MCU cmake
  file (see MCU_CONFIG) is existing so we are using a already known MCU.
  The first thing to do is to copy everything from the STMCubeIDE project core directory
  to ~PH_WIP/src/<prj>~

  Here is an example

  #+HEADER: :eval never-export  :results output :wrap example :exports both
  #+begin_src bash :dir "/tmp"

    #Create a new project directory
    mkdir ${HOME}/PH_WIP/src/MyPrj
    # Copy all existing StmCubeIde file under Core
    cp -r ${HOME}/STM32CubeIDE/WorkSpace/MyProject/Core \
       ${HOME}/PH_WIP/src/MyPrj

    # Copy an existing cmake file from a project with the same MCU
    cp -r ${HOME}/PH_WIP/src/Stepper/CMakeLists.txt ${HOME}/PH_WIP/src/MyPrj

    #Edit the file by setting a new target name..
    sed -i 's/Stepper/MyPrj/g' ${HOME}/PH_WIP/src/MyPrj/CMakeLists.txt

    # Now we need to edit the MCU_CONF file to add our project, that should tie the MyPrj
    # to stm32f401 as a Flavor (see ccmake)
    sed -i -e '/set_property/s/STEPPER/STEPPER MyPrj/' cmake/mcu_conf/stm32f401xc.cmake
  #+end_src


  You also need to add the *project* to the ~src/CMakeLists.txt~ as an /elseif/ statement.


  #+begin_src cmake
  elseif( FLAVOR STREQUAL "MyProj")
  add_subdirectory(MyPrj)
  #+end_src



  There are however some things that probably needs to be changed .
  for example the ~Src~ directory in your new project might consists
  of other files that needs to be compiled, and since you copied the
  /CMakeLists.txt/ you need to do some minor adjustment for example
  the source files and project name. These files needs to be added to the /SRC/ in the
  ~CMakeLists.txt~ in you new project, and don't forget to change the executable name.

   #+begin_src cmake
     set(TARGET_BIN "sml_test")

     add_executable(${TARGET_BIN} ${SRC})

     set(SRC
       Src/main.c
       .
       .
       .
       Src/syscalls.c
       Src/sysmem.c
       Src/<new files.(c|cpp)
       )
   #+end_src


  The new project also needs a memory map script ( if you not already using an existing).
  these are located in ~libs/conf/mem~. When using /StmCubeIde/ these files are located in the root direcotry
  of your project.

  #+begin_src bash
    ls libs/conf/mem
  #+end_src

  | STM32F103T8UX_FLASH.ld |
  | STM32F401CCUX_FLASH.ld |
  | STM32F411RETX_FLASH.ld |

  If you are adding a new one, the /mcu config/ file needs to be changed.
  In other words the one of the files located in ~cmake/mcu_conf/.cmake~
  There you will find a line consisting of:
  ~set(MCU_MEMORY_LAYOUT_FILES "STM32F401CCUX_FLASH.ld")~ for example:

  #+HEADER: :eval never-export  :results output :wrap example :exports both
  #+begin_src bash
    sed -i 's|STM32F401CCUX_FLASH.ld|my_linker_script_name.ld|g' cmake/mcu_conf/stm32f401xc.cmake
  #+end_src





** TODO Adding a new MCU
* TODO Tests

Unit test are compiled using /ExternalProject_add/ and is built
nativly. To make it even simpler [[https://conan.io/][conan]] is used (both conan1 and conan2
is supported).
